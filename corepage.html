        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in Brazil, with my parents and four siblings. My father was
          self-employed, and things were always changing for him, so my family
          moved a lot from place to place throughout my whole life. That helped
          me develop one of my most vital traits—<b>adaptability</b>.

        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
          My goal at Dev Academy is to prepare for a job as a web developer.
          Long-term I would like to find a flexible (preferably remote) job, so
          I can still have time for my kids. During my time here, I would love
          to feel like I belong in the tech community and understand how the
          day-to-day life of a developer is.

        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Also known as emotional quotient or EQ, emotional intelligence is the
          capacity to recognise and control our actions and emotions—and how
          they affect people around us. It also means understanding how others
          feel and responding appropriately.

        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the ability the brain has to adapt by forming new
          neuron connections. It changes how its circuits are wired. When we
          repeatedly practise an activity or access a memory, we make changes in
          our brain and our neural networks shape themselves accordingly.
