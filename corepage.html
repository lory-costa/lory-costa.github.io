        <h2>Identity, Values and Strenghts Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in Brazil, with my parents and four siblings. My father was
          self-employed, and things were always changing for him, so my family
          moved a lot from place to place throughout my whole life. That helped
          me develop one of my most vital traits—<b>adaptability</b>.

        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
          My goal at Dev Academy is to prepare for a job as a web developer.
          Long-term I would like to find a flexible (preferably remote) job, so
          I can still have time for my kids. During my time here, I would love
          to feel like I belong in the tech community and understand how the
          day-to-day life of a developer is.
