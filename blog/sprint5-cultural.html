          At Dev Academy, we spend a fair amount of time focusing on core
          learning—soft-skill development. They have us do this because they
          want to prepare us for the reality of a job in the tech industry—the
          technical knowledge alone will get us only halfway there.
        </p>

        <p>
          I thought it was valid exploring the concepts I did, I learned a lot,
          and they brought a different kind of mental exercise when I needed a
          break from coding.
        </p>

        <p>
          What surprised me the most about learning core was that I experienced
          a refreshing change in recognising my feelings and thoughts. I
          realised that to be a successful professional I need more than
          technical knowledge and experience; I need emotional intelligence. I
          learned that I am confident enough to make mistakes; I rediscovered my
          love of learning and recognised the importance of knowing my values.
          It's essential to know who you are and what you feel when trying to
          figure out where you want to go.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most challenging aspects of core learning was writing my
          findings. Even though I love writing, it's always testing to put your
          thoughts into words, but I enjoy the exercise, and I learn a lot from
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope to keep working on my core strengths and learnings and always
          cherish this experience of exploring them.
