        <h2>About my values</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in Brazil, with my parents and four siblings. My father was
          self-employed, and things were always changing for him, so my family
          moved a lot from place to place throughout my life. That helped me
          develop one of my most vital traits—<b>adaptability</b>. We didn't
          have many material things, but we were close and happy most of the
          time.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was eleven years old, my family joined the Church of Jesus
          Christ of Latter-day Saints, that changed our lives for good. With the
          gospel of Jesus Christ's principles, I learned
          <b>self-reliance</b> and acquired a great <b>desire for growth</b>.
          That has shaped my identity and values more than anything else in my
          life. Our net of friends expanded dramatically. We now knew many
          people from different parts of the world. That got me interested in
          learning other languages, especially English, which I didn't realise
          at the time, but would positively influence my life in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that time, I discovered my love for books, nature, dancing, and
          learning and I became better at making friends and paying more
          attention to people's needs. That lead me to serve as a missionary for
          the church when I was twenty-one—a delightful accomplishment that
          taught me the value of <b>compassion</b>, <b>discipline</b> and
          <b>hard work</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I got back home from my mission, I decided to leave my parent's
          house and move to Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil, where I
          studied Human Resources Management and met my husband, Matt. While
          working at two jobs to afford rent and pay for my studies, I
          discovered how <b>determined</b> I could be and how much I valued
          <b>independence</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I finished school two weeks before my wedding, and eighteen months
          later, we had a four-month-old baby and a plane ticket for Matt to
          come to New Zealand. Three months later, in August 2014, baby and I
          joined him, and together we made New Zealand our home. Leaving
          everything behind to have a chance at a better future for our kids was
          just the first of the sacrifices. We developed more <b>faith</b> and
          <b>resilience</b> and grew in our love for each other, as we journeyed
          on, with no family or friends' support while raising kids in a
          different country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life in New Zealand has been amazing to me. In 2015 I got a job as an
          HR coordinator, working with a fantastic team, met terrific people and
          learned a lot about the kiwi way of doing things. I fell in love with
          the culture from the beginning and did my best to be accepted and
          <b>accepting</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          After three years at the job, I decided to quit after I got back from
          maternity leave, I missed my baby too much, I was stressed, and I
          thought it was the right moment to focus on the kids. Then last year,
          after three years at home, I felt ready to go back to work, but
          thinking of HR didn't bring me joy, so I decided to look for something
          new, and here I am, at Dev Academy, showing my <b>courage</b> and
          <b>optimism</b>, <b>hoping</b> for a great future.

        <h2>About my strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>
          When contemplating what to do next, I retook a test I had taken years
          ago, the
          <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" class="link"
            >16 personalities test</a
          >. It turns out I haven't changed in all those years; I am still an
          INFJ or Advocate. Some of my strengths, according to the test, are:
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>Creative</li>
          <li>Insightful</li>
          <li>Principled</li>
          <li>Passionate</li>
          <li>Altruistic</li>
        </p>
        <p>And my weaknesses:</p>
        <p>
          <li>Sensitive to Criticism</li>
          <li>Reluctant to Open Up</li>
          <li>Perfectionistic</li>
          <li>Avoiding the Ordinary</li>
          <li>Prone to Burnout</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know to what extent I agree to all of those things, but I can
          see some of them in myself. I believe I am passionate and principled.
          When I commit to something or someone, I follow through, no matter
          what. And it is also true that I can be reluctant to open up, I tend
          to keep my problems and concerns to myself, and I am sensitive to some
          kinds of criticism, but marriage has helped me improve a lot in those
          areas. :)
        </p>

        <p>
          I think my determination and love of learning and feeling productive
          are a plus in terms of learning and career development. In contrast,
          my perfectionism can be an enemy in that area. Sometimes I have
          difficulty letting go, I want to keep working on the issue until it's
          perfect, but I know that that is not always the best approach, and I
          trust Dev Academy will have some lessons to teach me on that.
        </p>

        <p>
          I could not think of an ethical decision I had to make, but I have
          something to share on working productively with others when there was
          resistance or tension.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2017, when I worked as an HR coordinator, my relationship with my
          manager became distant. When I went on maternity leave, the department
          hired two people to replace me, a clear indicator of how overloaded I
          was. When I got back, my manager became gradually more irritable and
          impatient with me. She expected me to resume all the activities that
          my two replacements had been working on, and I did, as best as
          possible, but I had a massive amount of work and very little
          flexibility. So I decided the best approach would be to have an honest
          conversation. I started by writing her a letter, stating everything
          that was on my mind. The next day, I rewrote it, removing anything
          that didn't pass through
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhpBjqHhU14" class="link"
            >Socrates' three sieves</a
          >
          (this is something I have been doing since I was fifteen, it's a
          principle for me), and finally, I made it into bullet points and
          scheduled a meeting with her. I started by asking for her feedback on
          how I was doing, and then I said what I had to say. I then discovered
          she had been sick for several months and was struggling. We both left
          the room, after tears and hugs, with a new-found appreciation for each
          other, and determined to be more explicit about our feelings and
          goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a revealing and powerful experience for me. I learned that not
          everything is about me and that there has to be good communication for
          a team to work in harmony. If it were now, I would not wait until
          things got to that point, openness and empathy are fundamental to good
          teamwork.
