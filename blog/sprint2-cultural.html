        <p>
          My goal at Dev Academy is to prepare for a job as a web developer.
          Long-term I would like to find a flexible (preferably remote) job, so
          I can still have time for my kids. During my time here, I would love
          to feel like I belong in the tech community and understand how the
          day-to-day life of a developer is.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am determined, quick to learn, curious and organised. I have to
          improve my ability to research and learn how to rely on others.
        </p>

        <p>
          I plan to allocate time every day for my studies and communicate with
          my colleagues and facilitator often. I am committed to seeking help on
          Slack channels when I need it. I won't allow myself to be stuck for
          too long.
        </p>

        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to be honest in their feedback,
          non-judgemental and kind. And to be available when I need help.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding family commitments, my husband and I made plans even before
          I started, so I don't think I'll have problems there.
