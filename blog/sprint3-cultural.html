        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

        <p>
          Also known as emotional quotient or EQ, emotional intelligence is the
          capacity to recognise and control our actions and emotions—and how
          they affect people around us. It also means understanding how others
          feel and responding appropriately.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to psychologist Daniel Goleman, there are five elements to
          it:

          <li>
            <b>Self-Awareness</b>—understanding our emotions and how our actions
            affect others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Self-Regulation</b>—monitoring and controlling our behaviour,
            emotions and thoughts, and adjusting them depending on the
            situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Motivation</b>—people with a high degree of EI are usually
            motivated. They're willing to delay immediate results for long-term
            success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Empathy</b>—being aware of other people's feelings and emotions
            and trying to put ourselves in their shoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Social skills</b>—having the ability to build rapport and trust
            with others.
          </li>
        </p>

        <h2>How is it different from IQ?</h2>

        <p>
          Unlike EI, that encompasses emotions, IQ is more about logic, and it
          represents abilities such as:
          <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
          <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
          <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
          <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
          <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h2>

        <p>
          When worked upon, emotional intelligence can help us build stronger
          personal relationships and successful careers. It can also help us
          connect with our feelings, be more proactive in searching happiness
          and making informed decisions about what matters most in life.

          I found this
          <a
            href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/tests/personality/emotional-intelligence-test"
            class="link"
            >Emotional Intelligence test</a
          >. It is very comprehensive, so it takes about 45 minutes to complete,
          and it only gives you your score, you have to pay for the detailed
          report, but it's still quite interesting, the questions can make us
          think.
