        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the ability the brain has to adapt by forming new
          neuron connections. It changes how its circuits are wired. When we
          repeatedly practise an activity or access a memory, we make changes in
          our brain and our neural networks shape themselves accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Understanding this concept can positively impact the decisions we make
          in terms of our commitment to learning. We realise we don't need to be
          born with a specific set of skills; and that our brains can learn and
          grow. This knowledge alone is empowering.
        </p>

        <p>
          Constant practice is critical. Repeating an activity, retrieving a
          memory, and reviewing materials in various ways helps build more
          connections in the brain.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

        <p>
          Studies show that people who understand that their skills can be
          developed tend to achieve more than those who believe their talents
          are innate gifts.
        </p>

        <p>
          A growth mindset views failure as an opportunity for growth rather
          than evidence of unintelligence. When we think our brains can grow, we
          behave differently; we worry less about looking smart and put more
          energy into learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, the fixed mindset assumes that character,
          intelligence, and creative ability are static. It dislikes difficult
          situations and challenges. Striving for success becomes a way of
          maintaining a sense of being smart or skilled.
