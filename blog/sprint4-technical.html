      <h1 class="title">Problem Solving</h1>

          From the moment we are born, we start solving problems. Learning how
          to talk, hold a spoon, walk, button a shirt are a few examples of the
          first difficulties humans face. As we grow, some carers help us become
          better at it. In contrast, others like to solve our problems for us,
          limiting our development in this area. In either case, there comes a
          season in life when we have to figure things out independently.
        </p>

        <p>
          For various reasons, different people have different approaches to
          problem-solving. Still, it's a valuable skill, and we should all
          practice it. I am a naturally analytical person, so I have a system to
          deal with challenges. First, I need to understand what the problem is.
          Second, I explore possible strategies and choose one; only then will I
          solve the problem. The last and perhaps more important part of the
          process is to look back and reflect on the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past few weeks, I have learned a few new problem-solving
          techniques that will help me become a better web developer. Among my
          favourites are pseudocode, try and error, console.logging, googling,
          and, of course, improving my process with reflection. I know I still
          have a long way to go, but I feel confident I can tackle any problem
          with some persistence and a fair amount of optimism.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we think about it, what fun would life be without challenges? How
          would we grow, improve, achieve our goals, live life to its fullest if
          we didn't have problems to teach us? From this perspective, I am
          thankful for the obstacles in my way and for having these new skills
          to help me deal with them.
