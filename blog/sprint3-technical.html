        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

        <p>
          HTML is the combination of elements that give structure to the page.
          In contrast, CSS is the incorporation of styles that provide shape and
          colour to the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML can be likened to a skeleton, a body structure, and the CSS to
          the body's features.
        </p>

        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>

        <p>
          Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in
          a script. It's like reading a book, from left to right, top to bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          A loop is an element that is read and executed repeatedly until the
          criteria are met. It's like the 24-hour loop in which our days are
          measured; they keep repeating infinitely. The difference is that in
          JavaScript, we can program the loops to stop.
        </p>

        <h2>The DOM</h2>

        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it's like a window or an
          access portal into the contents of a webpage from JavaScript. It
          allows us to make changes to the document structure, style, and
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          A web page is a document that can either be displayed in the browser
          window or its HTML source. But it's the same document in both cases.
          The DOM is an object-oriented representation of that same document or
          web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as
          JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an
          index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on. So, if we wanted
          to access the third item in an array, we would need to write [2] next
          to the variable name. For example:
        </p>
        <img src="../icons/icon5.png" alt="Accessing data from array example" />
        <br />
        <p>
          In objects, properties can be accessed by using either dot or bracket
          notation. To get the value of the age key in a person object we could
          write person.age or person['age'].
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
        <p>
          A JavaScript function enables us to define a chunk of code, give it a
          name and then execute it as many times as we want. They can perform
          tasks or calculate values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions are handy because they are reusable and they can speed the
          workflow.
