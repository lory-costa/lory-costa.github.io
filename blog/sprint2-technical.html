        <p>
          To understand the position property, we first need to understand that
          every web page element is a block. These elements respect the
          attributes that are set, like width and height.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are five values in the position property that allow the
          positioning of those blocks: relative, absolute, fixed, static and
          sticky, each of them is useful and the choice of which one to use
          depends on the desired result. Here we explain the first three values.

        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <p>
          This position is relative to itself. If no attributes are set to the
          element (top, left, bottom or right), its positioning will not be
          affected. It will be as if the position was static. However, suppose
          an attribute is given, for example, top: 20px. In that case, the
          element will shift its position 20 pixels down from the top, where it
          would be.
        </p>
        <h2>Absolute</h2>
        <p>
          This type of positioning allows a page element to be placed precisely
          where desired. These values will be relative to the next parent
          element that have relative or absolute positioning. If there is no
          such parent, it will be placed relative to the page itself. Use the
          positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the
          location.
        </p>
        <h2>Fixed</h2>
        <p>
          Here the element is positioned relative to the page, not to any other
          element. So a fixed-positioned element will stay put when the page is
          scrolled. This positioning might be used for something like a
          navigation bar that needs to remain visible at all times.
